Task Duplication Bug: Users are able to accidentally duplicate tasks within a project, leading to confusion and redundancy in task management.

Deadline Notification Bug: Some users do not receive deadline notifications for tasks, causing them to miss important deadlines and impacting project timelines.

File Attachment Error: Users encounter errors when trying to attach files to tasks, resulting in incomplete task documentation and difficulty accessing necessary resources.

Task Status Display Issue: The task status (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed") does not update correctly in real-time, leading to inaccuracies in task tracking and team coordination.

Access Control Vulnerability: Certain users are able to access and modify tasks or project data that they should not have permissions for, posing a security risk and compromising data integrity.

Filtering and Search Functionality Failure: The filtering and search functionality within the task management system does not return accurate results, making it difficult for users to find specific tasks efficiently.

Mobile App Synchronization Bug: Changes made to tasks or projects on the web platform do not sync properly with the mobile app, causing discrepancies in task status and information between platforms.

Performance Degradation During High Load: The software experiences slowdowns or crashes when multiple users are simultaneously accessing and updating tasks within a project, impacting productivity during peak usage times.

Collaboration Commenting Bug: Comments added by users within the task interface do not display consistently for all team members, leading to miscommunication and disjointed collaboration efforts.

Customization Settings Reset Bug: Users' customization settings for task views or notifications are reset unexpectedly, causing frustration and requiring users to reconfigure their preferences repeatedly.

These are just a few examples of potential bugs that could arise in our hypothetical software project. Identifying and addressing such issues through thorough testing and ongoing quality assurance efforts is essential for delivering a reliable and user-friendly product.
